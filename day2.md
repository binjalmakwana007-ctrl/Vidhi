# Day 2 Notes

What is MVC?

MVC stands for Model, View, Controller.

- Model: Handles data and database logic.
- View: Handles the user interface (UI).
- Controller: Acts as a bridge between Model and View.

MVC helps in organizing code, making applications easy to manage and scalable.

What is API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface.

An API allows two different applications to communicate with each other.
It sends requests and receives responses in data formats like JSON.

APIs are commonly used to connect frontend and backend.

## Real-Life Example: Login System

1. User enters email and password on the login page (View).
2. The request is sent to the backend using an API.
3. Controller receives the request and processes it.
4. Model checks the user data in the database.
5. Response is sent back (success or error).
6. User is redirected or shown an error message.

This is how MVC and API work together in real applications.
